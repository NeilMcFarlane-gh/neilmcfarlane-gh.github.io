Part of the Masters in Bioinformatics course at KU Leuven is a class called Structural Bioinformatics, which consists of lectures and workshop sessions. In this course, I help in the workshop sessions where we learn how to gain biochemical insights into problems by viewing and analysing protein structural data.
