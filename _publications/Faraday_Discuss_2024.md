***Abstract:*** Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are an extensive and unique class of enzymes, which can regio- and stereo-selectively functionalise hydrocarbons by way of oxidation reactions. These enzymes are naturally occurring but have also been extensively applied in a synthesis context, where they are used as efficient biocatalysts. Recently, a biosynthetic pathway where a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase catalyses a critical step of the pathway was uncovered, leading to the production of a number of products which display high antitumour potency. In this work, we use computational techniques to gain insight into the factors that determine the relative yields of the different products. We use conformational search algorithms to understand the substrate stereochemistry. On a machine learned 3D protein structure, we use molecular docking to obtain a library of favourable poses for substrate-protein interaction. With molecular dynamics, we investigate the most favourable poses for reactivity on a molecular level, allowing us to investigate which protein-substrate interactions favour a given product and thus gain insight into the product selectivity.
