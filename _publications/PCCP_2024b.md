***Abstract:*** The transsulfuration pathway plays a key role in mammals for maintaining the balance between cysteine and homocysteine, whose concentrations are critical in several biochemical processes. Human cystathionine β-synthase is a heme-containing, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme found in this pathway. The heme group does not participate directly in catalysis, but has a regulatory function, whereby CO or NO binding inhibits the PLP-dependent reactions. In this study, we explore the detailed structural changes responsible for inhibition using quantum chemical calculations to validate the experimentally observed bonding patterns associated with heme CO and NO binding and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the medium-range structural changes triggered by gas binding and propagating to the PLP active site, which is more than 20 Å distant from the heme group. Our results support a previously proposed mechanical signaling model, whereby the cysteine decoordination associated with gas ligand binding leads to breaking of a hydrogen bond with an arginine residue on a neighbouring helix. In turn, this leads to a shift in position of the helix, and hence also of the PLP cofactor, ultimately disrupting a key hydrogen bond that stabilizes the PLP in its catalytically active form.
