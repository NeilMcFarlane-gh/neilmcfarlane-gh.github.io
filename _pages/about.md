✨***Looking for Postdoctoral opportunities from October 2024***✨

Thanks for visiting my website! I am Neil, a passionate, early-career researcher finishing my Ph.D. in computational chemistry at KU Leuven. Over my time in higher education, I have become proficient in chemical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, bioinformatics, and software development. Throughout my Ph.D., I have leveraged the skills learned from my experiences to take a multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving. 

Coming to the end of the education chapter of my life, I am eager to explore my future in research further, so I am ***looking for work in research*** in academia or industry.
