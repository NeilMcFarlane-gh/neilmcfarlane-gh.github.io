Thanks for visiting my website! I am Neil, and I am currently working as a Data Engineer in the renewables sector at Marlinks. I am a big believer in sustainable energy solutions for the future of our planet. Working in this sector allows me to contribute directly to the transition towards cleaner energy. I am driven by the opportunity to innovate and apply data-driven approaches that can optimize renewable energy systems and make a tangible impact on society.

In addition to my current role, I have developed expertise across a wide range of fields, including data science, chemistry, biochemistry, structural biology, bioinformatics, chemical engineering, mathematics, and software development. This multidisciplinary background enables me to approach complex problems from multiple perspectives. My experience in renewables has further strengthened my commitment to leveraging technology and scientific knowledge to build a more sustainable and resilient future for everyone.
