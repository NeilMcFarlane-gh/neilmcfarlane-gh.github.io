✨***Looking for Postdoctoral opportunities***✨

Thanks for visiting my website! I am Neil, an early career researcher with specialisation in computational (bio)chemistry. Over my time in higher education, I have become proficient in chemical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, structural biology, bioinformatics, and software development. I have learned to leverage my diverse skillset to take a multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving.
