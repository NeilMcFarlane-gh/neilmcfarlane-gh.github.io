Thanks for visiting my website! I am Neil, currently working as a Data Engineer in the renewables sector @ Marlinks. 

Besides my current role, I have become proficient in many other sectors, including: data science, chemistry, biochemistry, structural biology, bioinformatics, chemical engineering, mathematics, and software development. I have learned to leverage my diverse skillset to take a multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving.
