✨***Looking for Postdoctoral opportunities***✨

Thanks for visiting my website! I am Neil, a passionate, early career researcher in computational chemistry and structural biology. Over my time in higher education, I have become proficient in chemical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, bioinformatics, and software development. I have leveraged the skills learned from my experiences to take a multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving.
